/**
 * A buffer designed especially to hold pooled connections (free and busy ones)
 * <p>
 * The buffer contains two linkedLists (free and busy connection nodes) and optional
 * affinityLists.
 * <p>
 * The PooledConnections holds references to list-Nodes, which can be reused.
 * This avoids object creation/gc during add/unlink operations.
 * <p>
 * The connectionBuffer itself has one freeList, that contains all free connections
 * ordered by their last-used time. (the oldest connection is at the end)
 * In parallel, connections in the freeList can also be in an affinityList.
 * A hashing algoritm is used to distribute the connections to the affinityLists.
 * <p>
 * If <code>hashSize == 0</code> affinity support is disabled, and the connectionBuffer
 * handles only free and busyList.
 * <p>
 * Otherwise, there are <code>hashSize+1</code> affinityLists.
 * <p>
 * The last one is used for affinity-less connections and for the others, the
 * <code>object.hashCode() mod hashSize</code> is computed.
 * <p>
 * (When affinity is enabled, and no affinityID is used, <code>freeList</code>
 * and <code>affinityLists[hashSize]</code> have the same content.)
 * <p>
 * When we call <code>removeFree(someObjKey)</code>,
 * <ul>
 *   <li>try to return a matching connection from the according affinity-list slot</li>
 *   <li>try to return a connection with affinityId == null</li>
 *   <li>return null (and let the caller decide to create a new connection or query
 *   again with <code>GET_OLDEST</code> to return the last free connecion)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A free node is member in two lists:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>it is member in the freeList</li>
 *     <li>it is EITHER member in one of the affinity-hash-slots
 *     OR it is member of the <code>null</code> (=last) affiinity-slot</li>
 * </ol>
 * The remove / transition from free to busy will remove the node from both lists.
 * <p>
 * Graphical exammple
 * <pre>
 *     By default, the busy list is empty
 *     busyList (empty)
 *     freeList --> c1 --> c2 --> c3 --> c4 --> (end)
 *     al[0]    (empty - first hash slot)
 *     al[1]    (empty)
 *     al[2]    (empty)
 *     ...
 *     al[N-1]  (empty - last hash slot)
 *     al[N]    --> c1 --> c2 --> c3 --> c4 --> (end - null slot)
 *
 *     if a removeFree(1) is called, we lookup in al[1] and found no usable node.
 *     in this case, we return the first node of al[N] that has no affinity yet.
 *     When we remove the node from the affinityList, it is automatically removed
 *     from the freeList
 *
 *     busyList --> c1 --> (end)
 *     freeList ---------> c2 --> c3 --> c4 --> (end)
 *     al[0]    (empty)
 *     al[1]    (empty)
 *     al[2]    (empty)
 *     ...
 *     al[N-1]  (empty)
 *     al[N]    ---------> c2 --> c3 --> c4 --> (end)
 *
 *     When we put that node back in the freelist, it becomes the first node
 *     and it will be also linked in al[1]
 *
 *     busyList (empty)
 *     freeList --> c1 --> c2 --> c3 --> c4 --> (end)
 *     al[0]    (empty)
 *     al[1]    --> c1 --> (end)
 *     al[2]    (empty)
 *     ...
 *     al[N-1]  (empty)
 *     al[N]    ---------> c2 --> c3 --> c4 --> (end)
 *
 *     now we call removeFree(2) tree times. This will move c2 to c4 to busy list
 *     busyList --> c4 --> c3 --> c2 --> (end)
 *     freeList --> c1 ----------------> (end)
 *     al[0]    (empty)
 *     al[1]    --> c1 --> (end)
 *     al[2]    (empty)
 *     ...
 *     al[N-1]  (empty)
 *     al[N]    (empty)
 *
 *     when we return the connections (c4 to c2), we have this picture
 *     and there are no more affinity nodes left.
 *
 *     busyList (empty)
 *     freeList --> c2 --> c3 --> c4 --> c1 --> (end)
 *     al[0]    (empty)
 *     al[1]    --> c1 --> (end)
 *     al[2]    --> c2 --> c3 --> c4 --> (end)
 *     ...
 *     al[N-1]  (empty)
 *     al[N]    (empty)
 *
 *     subsequent queries to affinityId=1 / 2 will return c1, respectively c2..c4
 *
 *     querying for a connection with affinityId=3 will return null,
 *     because there is neither a matching one nor a null one.
 *
 *     The caller can now decide to create a new connection "c5" or
 *     query with GET_OLDEST for "c1"
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * All thread safety controlled externally (by PooledConnectionQueue).
